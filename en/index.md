## Dofus Meter
Dofus Meter is an unofficial application for the MMORPG Dofus. It is free and developped on free time.

Its goal is to provide a simple tool for measuring damage and in-game heal using graphs. It is the lighter and simpler successor of [Dofixed](https://dofixed.github.io/).

Various settings are available to customize the display and calculate graphs.

## Usage
### Install

You can download .zip file containing the application by following [this link](https://github.com/DofusMeter/archive/raw/master/DofusMeter.zip).

Extract this .zip file in a folder dedicated to Dofus Meter (where ever you want as long as the folder is empty).

### Launch

Make sure your Dofus client is properly configured to use port `5555` (this is the default port, if you haven't changed anything it should already be).

Directly launch `DofusMeter.exe`.

The main window will appear, as well as an icon in the notification area.

*NB: You can create a shortcut from `DofusMeter.exe` by right clicking on it, then` Send to > Desktop (Create a shortcut) `.*

### Update

Dofus Meter will update itself on each launch.

### Uninstall

Delete the folder in which you extracted the .zip archive, then delete folder `%AppData%\Dofixed\DofusMeter`.

## Limitations

*  Windows 10

## Warning

Please note, Dofus Meter has not been authorized by ANKAMA company. The Terms and Conditions of Use (TCU) of the game state that it is forbidden to use third party tools or to advertise them on the official game / forum. Dofus Meter therefore does not respect the TCU and a risk of ban is always present. The Dofus Meter team cannot be held responsible for any ban. However, Dofus Meter does not modify the game or its files, it only observes and displays information. It is by no means a bot and no action is automated. Therefore, the use of Dofus Meter is no more detectable by the game than that of Paint or Discord, and we would be very surprised to see a ban happen.
